still notquite sure about

- how to make cute little launcher application? Possibly via seperate console app that launches wezterm? Seems exessive.

## Platform Specific Implementations

It might be time to think about installing some Mac & Windows specific things so that I can use these applications in a way that makes sense to me in both instances.

I was thinking this would be a good idea, but upon reflaction, I think it will actually make more sense to align both platforms behind `ALT` and `ALT|LEADER`

I have actually done this, although I am not sure I am using it for it's most effective. I have also removed the tabline config as it was getting a bit much. 

Might need to work out how to back up my .zshrc file.
